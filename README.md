# c06-weather-dashboard

## Description

This project acts as a weather dashboard using the openweathermap api.

Working through this project has helped me feel more comfortable with JS in general,
however it's showed me that I still have a lot to learn with anything that adjust the CSS.

Disappointed with how the UI turned out, but hoping to get better at it with practice.

understand the styling.

## Features

Search for the current weather and a 5 day forecast using the search bar. All cities searched will 
be saved locally to help you navigate back previous searches.

In the future, I'd like to update this so that I can make sure the list only holds a set
number of responses.
